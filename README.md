# Tools
Differents tools that i'm often using while programming

List of all tools :

- install - Installs all the tools in your ~/bin/ dir

- mkproject - Creates a project with all needed files (using the template dir) + git

- blim (By Gnidmoo) - an overlay of epitech-BLIH.

- github - A little script that creates the context for a github project from an epitech project

- testproject - A script that's gonna apply multiple tests (from a test file) on an executable and compare the output with what's expected.

- up - A function to add to your bashrc that can do "cd .." n times.

- mrclean - A tool that clean all your temp files (.o, .gch, *~, #*#, etc...)
